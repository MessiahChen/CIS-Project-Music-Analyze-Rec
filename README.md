# CIS-Project-Music-Analyze-Rec
This is the Music Analyze and Recommend Project for CIS Research.<br>It uses the dataset on https://github.com/mdeff/fma.

Motivation: Everyone likes to find and listen to new songs, but who has the time to iterate through hundreds of millions of songs just to find a few new good ones? Nobody.
The goal of this project is to utilize the audio feature clustering extracted from raw audio files (mp3s) and build a simple song recommender that suggests new tracks based on user preferences and inputs. 
The idea behind this recommender is first to do clustering on the Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset and reveal what cluster of songs, or perhaps, "vibes" the user enjoys, and subsequently recommend songs that are new to the user and all share some similar combination of signal features that the user has chosen.
